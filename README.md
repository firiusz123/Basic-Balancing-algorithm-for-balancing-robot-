# Basic-Balancing-algorithm-for-balancing-robot-
this is program made for baancing robot with a Husarion as a main computing unit ,  the rest of components (motors and sensor ) were used from the lego Mindstorms 
so basicaly it uses a simple math to determine the offset angle of robot fron vetical axis of it and then uses a common PID  controller to power motors and 
decreese the degree between robot and vertical axis so simply speaking actually make it balance
